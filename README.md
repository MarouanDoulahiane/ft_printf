# ft_printf

## About
The `ft_printf` project challenges you to reimplement the `printf` function in C. By undertaking this project, you'll gain valuable insights into using variadic arguments and learn how to develop a library containing a simplified version of the `printf` function.

For more detailed information, refer to the [subject of this project](https://github.com/Surfi89/42cursus/blob/main/Subject%20PDFs/01_Born2beRoot_en.pdf).

## Usage

### Requirements
To compile and use the function, ensure you have the following:
- `cc` compiler
- Standard C libraries

### Instructions

1. **Compiling the library:**

Navigate to the library path and execute:
```shell
$ make
```
Using it in your code:
Include the library's header file in your code:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"
```
### Testing
You can use third-party testers like [Tripouille/printfTester](https://github.com/Tripouille/printfTester) for comprehensive testing.
